# Survey form with React

This weeks project was about building a survey form with react. The user fills out the form and by submitting getting a summery of the answer displayed. The form consist three different question types (select, input, radio button).

## The problem

I started by structuring the project on paper. This helped me to get a better idea of what part of the survey will be included in what component. I got the single components on browser quite quickly and did lots of console.logs to assure that it was working as it should and that the states were stored. When something was not working I knew right away which step the problem was. The first bigger struggle was getting the summary displayed by clicking submit. It took me some time to getting my head around the waterfall principle of states. Talking to my team about this and verbalizing it helped a lot. While working on the displaying summary I learned the hard way what "discard all changes" can do. I deleted a lot of my code and had to figure out at which state was last saved. I now know by own experience how important commiting and pushing is. This week my teammembers and I met more often for a quick check-in or exchanged on slack where were standing at & to discuss our different codes, which is helpful in general to understand my own approach better.
