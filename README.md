# Bootcamp-Project #08: Survey form with React

This weeks project was about building a survey form with react and using "State" to display a summery of the answers in the end. The form consists of three different question types (select, input, radio button).

## Learning content and lessons learned:
- JavaScript
- use form fields with React
- useState
- work with components 

I started by structuring the project on paper. This helped me to structure the project into components. I got the survey working quite quickly and did lots of console.logs to assure that it was working as it should and that the states were stored. It took me some time to wrapping my head around the waterfall principle of states. Talking to my team about this and verbalizing it helped a lot. 
This week I learned the hard way what "discard all changes" can do. I deleted a lot of my code, cause I missed out on commiting more. I now know how important commiting and pushing is.
This week my teammembers and I met more often for a quick check-in or exchanged on slack where everybody was standing at and to discuss our different codes, which was very helpful understand my own approach better.
